# Welcome to Chirag Parmar's GitHub! üëã

**Current Status:** Nim Developer @ [StatusIM](https://github.com/status-im) and doing some p2p research on the side ([pubsub-shadow](https://github.com/ppopth/pubsub-shadow))

Hello! I'm Chirag Parmar. I completed my Masters of Science in Communications Engineering from the Technical University of Munich. At TUM, I defended my thesis titled "Implementation of FrodoKEM on Opentitan platform". During my undergraduate studies, I spent a semester at the University of California, Berkeley, learning product design and entrepreneurship. Since 2017, I have been actively working on self-sovereign identity, key recovery, and other blockchain-related technologies.

Driven by curiosity, I quickly adapt and enjoy learning new languages and technologies. Rather than sticking to just one, I actively explore different tools and platforms, which is evident in my repositories and contributions.

Below is a categorical breakdown of both my repositories and my projects so far. The lists are repetitive since some projects span multiple categories. Feel free to explore my repositories to see my work in action. I am always open to collaboration and new opportunities.

* [Blockchain Technology](#blockhain-technology) üîó
* [Hardware Security and Cryptography](#hardware-security-and-cryptography) üîí
* [Hobby Projects in IoT, ML, AR, and Distributed Systems](#hobby-projects-in-iot-ml-ar-and-distributed-systems) üåê
* [Hackathon Submissions](#hackathon-submissions) üöÄ

#### Blockchain Technology üîó
1. **Nimbus Execution Client** [nimbus-eth1](https://github.com/status-im/nimbus-eth1) - [nim-eth](https://github.com/status-im/nim-eth)
2. **Ethereum Protocol Fellowship - Rated List** [rated-list-specs](https://github.com/dankrad/rated-list-specs)
3. **Incentivized Node Network (IN3)** [Client](https://github.com/blockchainsllc/in3) - [Server](https://github.com/blockchainsllc/in3-server)
   * I worked on the Merkle Patricia tree implementation of the server and developed various other parts of the server. I also discovered a private key leakage that I'm very proud of üòä
   * On the client side, I worked on building an SSI plugin for Evan.network's [Vade](https://github.com/evannetwork/vade) framework, although this was later part of the Equs SDK.
4. **Vade Integration in Equs**
   * The task was simple but nuanced. I had to use the provided FFI by the Evan team to integrate Vade into Equs SDK (formerly IN3). [Here](https://github.com/blockchainsllc/vade-bin) you can see cross compilations of the Rust binary.
   * I further expanded the integration as bindings into .NET, Swift, WASM, and Java.
5. **[Metamask Extension with IN3 support](https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension/issues/7868)**
6. **One of my very first projects in Blockchain** (please don't judge): A naive ENS auction scrapper [ShowMeTheHash](https://github.com/chirag-parmar/ShowMeTheHash)
7. **Ethereum-ready nRF52 embedded systems** - [Secure Bootloader](https://github.com/chirag-parmar/nrf52-secure-boot), [Signer Template](https://github.com/chirag-parmar/nrf-in3-template)
8. **Research:** Biometric key recovery using Fuzzy extractors and Fuzzy commitment schemes (Unfortunately, the research was proprietary)
9. **Research:** Practical Social Key Recovery using secret sharing techniques (Even this research was proprietary)

#### Hardware Security and Cryptography üîí
1. **Masters Thesis:** Implementation of FrodoKEM on Opentitan platform
2. **[Survey of using DRAM PUFs for Authentication](https://github.com/chirag-parmar/drams-pufs-research)**
3. **[Analysis of power leakages in Cryptographic Implementations of AES](https://github.com/chirag-parmar/dpa-attacks-analysis)**
4. **[Smashing the stack and using gadgets for hijacking execution](https://github.com/chirag-parmar/embedded-systems-security)**
5. **[nRF52 Secure Bootloader](https://github.com/chirag-parmar/nrf52-secure-boot)**
6. **[nRF52 Embedded Ethereum Signer](https://github.com/chirag-parmar/nrf-in3-template)**
7. **[My solution to the Cryptopals Challenges](https://github.com/chirag-parmar/Cryptopals)**
8. **[Ingonyama's DLOG Challenge](https://github.com/chirag-parmar/breaking-weak-crypto)**

#### Hobby Projects in IoT, ML, AR, and Distributed Systems üåê
1. **[2GUD](https://github.com/chirag-parmar/2GUD)**
   * A fun project building a distributed file storage with basic fault tolerance.
2. **[Rpi Pico Game Engine for Lode Runner](https://github.com/chirag-parmar/pico-lode-runner)**
3. **[FaceRecognition on Rpi using FaceAPI](https://github.com/chirag-parmar/Face-Recognition)**
4. **[An AR Encyclopedia built over the book AskMeAnything](https://github.com/chirag-parmar/AskMeAnything)**
5. **[An Arduino-based NFC door lock](https://github.com/chirag-parmar/ArduinoNFC)**
