## Welcome to Chirag Parmar's GitHub!

Hello! I'm Chirag Parmar, a passionate engineer and developer with a diverse background in communications and electronics engineering. I completed my Masters of Science in Communications Engineering from the Technical University of Munich. During my undergraduate studies, I had the opportunity to spend a semester at the University of California, Berkeley, where I learned product design and entrepreneurship. Since 2017, I have been actively working on self-sovereign identity, key recovery (social and non-custodial), and other blockchain-related technologies. Currently, I am an active participant in the Ethereum Protocol Fellowship, where I am working on the Rated List project. 

In addition, I am working on developing home automation devices tailored for the Indian market. This project is a valuable opportunity to apply and integrate all the skills I have gathered so far, starting from hardware security, cryptography, communications engineering to product design, and entrepreneurship. It has been both challenging and rewarding.

Below is a categorical breakdown of both, my repositories and my projects so far. The lists are repetitive since some projects span multiple categories

#### Blockhain Technology
1. Incentivized Node Network(IN3) [Client](https://github.com/blockchainsllc/in3) - [Server](https://github.com/blockchainsllc/in3-server)
	* I worked on the merkle patricia tree implementation of the server and developed various other parts of the server. I also discovered a private key leakage that I'm very proud of :)
	* On the client side I worked on building an SSI plugin for Evan.network's [Vade](https://github.com/evannetwork/vade) framework although this was later part of the Equs SDK
2. Vade Integration in Equs
	* The task was simple but nuanced. I had to use the provided FFI by the evan team to integrate Vade into Equs SDK(formerly IN3). [Here](https://github.com/blockchainsllc/vade-bin) you can see cross compilations of the rust binary.
	* I further expanded the intergration as bindings into .NET, Swift, WASM and Java
	* [Metamask Extension with IN3 support](https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension/issues/7868)
3. One of my very first projects in Blockchain(please don't judge): A naive ENS auction scrapper [ShowMeTheHash](https://github.com/chirag-parmar/ShowMeTheHash)
4. Ethereum-ready nRF52 embedded systems - [Secure Bootloader](https://github.com/chirag-parmar/nrf52-secure-boot), [Signer Template](https://github.com/chirag-parmar/nrf-in3-template)
5. Research: Biometric key recovery using Fuzzy extractors and Fuzzy commitment schemes (Unfortunately, the research was proprietary)
6. Research: Practical Social Key Recovery using secret sharing techniques (Even this research was proprietary)

#### Hardware Security and Cryptography
1. Masters Thesis: Implementation of FrodoKEM on Opentitan platform [TODO: ask for permission to publish the thesis report on github]
2. [Survey of using DRAM PUFs for Authentication](https://github.com/chirag-parmar/drams-pufs-research) 
3. [Analysis of power leakages in Cryptogrpahic Implementations of AES](https://github.com/chirag-parmar/dpa-attacks-analysis)
	* This repository only simulates and analyzes there were other courses like Smart Card Security that delved into real-world DPA attacks.
4. [Smashing the stack and using gadgets for hijacking execution](https://github.com/chirag-parmar/embedded-systems-security)
	* Apologies, this was coursework hence it is unorganized. Assignment 2 is the relevant assignment for buffer overflow
5. [nRF52 Secure Bootloader](https://github.com/chirag-parmar/nrf52-secure-boot)
6. [nRF52 Embedded Ethereum Signer](https://github.com/chirag-parmar/nrf-in3-template)
7. [My solution to the Cryptopals Challenges](https://github.com/chirag-parmar/Cryptopals)
8. [Ingonyama's Challenge]() (TODO: Upload Repository)

#### Hobby Projects in IoT, ML, AR and Distributed Systems
1. [2GUD](https://github.com/chirag-parmar/2GUD)
	* A fun project building a distributed file storage with basic fault tolerance.
2. [Rpi Pico Game Engine for Lode Runner](https://github.com/chirag-parmar/pico-lode-runner)
3. [FaceRecognition on Rpi using FaceAPI](https://github.com/chirag-parmar/Face-Recognition)
4. [An AR Encyclopedia built over the book AskMeAnything](https://github.com/chirag-parmar/AskMeAnything)
5. [An Arduino based NFC door lock](https://github.com/chirag-parmar/ArduinoNFC)
6. [A Development Board for ESP8266](https://github.com/chirag-parmar/ESP8266-dev_board)
7. [Driver Assist](https://github.com/chirag-parmar/Driver-Assist) - OpenCV based Traffic light detection system
8. [GuageBoltIOT](https://github.com/chirag-parmar/GaugeBoltIOT) - A vanilla JS based UI element

#### Hackathon Submissions
1. [RoboCrop](https://github.com/chirag-parmar/RoboCrop)
2. [DecentralizedIoT](https://github.com/chirag-parmar/Decentralised-IoT)
3. [Xtencion](https://github.com/chirag-parmar/Xtencion)

Feel free to explore my repositories to see my work in action. I am always open to collaboration and new opportunities. Let's build something amazing together!
